## General Requirements

- This is a solo project! (Just to clarify, you may do the same game as another student, but you may not work together.)
- This game cannot be a game or assignment we've already done in class.
- This game must run in a web browser.
- This game must be tracked in Github, with a minimum of 10 commits.
- Ideally, put your empty project up on Github on day one of development and aim for multiple commits per day.
- This game must be deployed on Github Pages or another location.

## Game Requirements

- The game can be designed for 2 or more players (PvP) or for 1 player (PvE). 
- The second player in a PvP game can be a person or an AI. (In this case, think of "AI" as a logical pattern.)
- For multi-player games, turns should switch appropriately between players
- The game should be winnable, or it should keep score (or track player progress in a meaningful way). 
- When a player wins or loses, the game status and/or score should display visually to the player in a way that does not rely on console.logs or alerts. 
- If there is a valid draw (tie) condition in your chosen game, that should be implemented.
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript should be written in separate files.- Effort must be spent on styling and appearance.
- The HTML code should use sematic tags.
- The GitHub repository for your game should have a README.md that describes the inspiration for the game, explains the controls and how to play the game, lists the technologies used to build the game, and addresses any outstanding bugs or unfinished functionality.

# NYU-SD-01 Milestone Project: Planning

_Before you start programming your project_... plan it!

Complete the planning sections below and include them in the README.md of your project repository. Once you're done, reach out to your instructional staff -- they'll examine your plan, help you scope it appropriately for the tools available to you and think ahead toward technical solutions, and point out any areas that could use any more thought. _Use the template below!_

--------

## Deployment

The web game is deployed at < https://isaacc01.github.io/1Milestoneproject-IH/>.

## Project Description

_(The video game you are about to experience will take you on a journey where your dragon will need to collect mushrooms wherever they appear without exciting the forest. Your dragon tail will keep growing everytime you eat a mushroom. If you can keep up with the speed and not exit the wall or run into yourself you will win.)
    

## Game Logic

The player can move the dragon with the arrows to campture the mushrooms. When the player makes the choice by pressing an arrow the dragon will move in that direction. The logic for the player's victory is surviving continuously capturing mushrooms for 2 minutes. The player will loose if the dragon runs into one of the walls or if the dragon eats its own self. For the procress, the dragon will stay alive and continue to eat if it continues to eat mushrooms. 
```

### MVP Criteria

- This is a solo project.
- The game must be able to run on the browser.
- This game must be tracked in GitHub with a minimum of 10 commits.
- This game must be deployed on GitHub Pages.
- This game must be designed for at least 1 player.
- When a player wins or loses, the game status and/or score should display visually to the player in a way that does not rely on 
  console.logs or alerts.
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript should live in seperate files.
- Efforts must be spent on styling and apprearance.
- The HTML code should use semantic tags.
- THe game should have a Readme.md file in the GitHUb respository that describes the inspiration for the game, explains the       
  controls and how to play the game, lists the technologies used to build the game, and the addresses any outstanding bugs or unfinished fuctionality. 
- My game must show strong competency for this subject, demostrate solid understanding of use cases, best practice, and how to
  execute on the skill being measured. 


## Deliverables

>Even if you have a great big idea for a game, it's important to scope this project according to what you can get done in the next two weeks. We'll refer to your project completion goal using the term **[Minimum Viable Product]
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) (MVP)** -- a list of the criteria needed to "ship" a playable version of your game that meets the project requirements.
>
>*Don't lose sight of your big ideas, though! Keep a list of further improvements you can refer to as 

### Post-MVP Plans

- I hope to be able to add a celebration promp if you win the game.
- Another goal that will be a stretch is adding one if you lose. 
- I hope to add a gif or short video for the intro., which I have no idea how to do.
