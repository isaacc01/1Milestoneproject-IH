## Deployment

The web game is deployed at <https://isaacc01.github.io/1Milestoneproject-IH/>.

## Project Description

_(The video game you are about to experience will take you on a journey where your dragon will need to collect mushrooms wherever they appear without exciting the temple. Your dragon tail will keep growing everytime you eat a mushroom. If you can keep up with the speed and not exit the wall or run into yourself you will win.)
    

## Game Logic

The player can move the dragon with the arrows to capture the mushrooms. When the player makes the choice by pressing an arrow the dragon will move in that direction. The logic for the player's victory is surviving continuously capturing mushrooms for 1 minute. The player will loose if the dragon runs into one of the walls or if the dragon eats its own self. For the procress, the dragon will stay alive and continue to eat if it continues to eat mushrooms.
